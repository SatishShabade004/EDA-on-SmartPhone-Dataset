# 📱 Smartphone Price Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project explores how various smartphone features — such as RAM, storage, processor speed, 5G support, fast charging, and brand — influence pricing in the Indian smartphone market.

Using Python and visual analytics, I performed a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify price trends, feature impact, and product segmentation across brands.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- The dataset contains detailed specifications of smartphones available in India.
- Key columns include:  
  `price`, `ram_capacity`, `internal_memory`, `processor_speed`, `battery_capacity`, `primary_camera_rear`, `num_cores`, `has_5g`, `fast_charging`, `brand_name`, and more.
- The goal was to understand **which features most strongly influence smartphone prices** and how brands position their models.

## 🔧 Project Workflow

1. **Objective Definition**  
   → Identify price-influencing features and market trends using smartphone specs

2. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   → Imported CSV file, explored columns, data types, summary stats, and missing values

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values using median/mode imputation
   - Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., `ratings`, `extended_upto`)
   - Renamed and corrected column types for clarity

4. **Feature Selection & Transformation**  
   → Selected relevant features like RAM, ROM, processor speed, etc., and converted types for analysis

5. **EDA & Visualization**  
   - Bar plots for brand distribution  
   - Histogram, KDE plot, and boxplot for price distribution  
   - Scatter plots and boxplots to explore feature-price relationships  
   - Heatmap for correlation between numeric features

6. **Insight Generation & Final Recommendations**

## 📊 Key Insights

- **RAM and Internal Storage** are the strongest price drivers — phones with 6GB+ RAM and 128GB+ storage are consistently more expensive.
- **Processor Speed** has a positive influence on price — faster phones are priced higher.
- **5G and Fast Charging** support are premium features — smartphones with these show higher median prices.
- **Camera Megapixels** and **Battery Capacity** don’t significantly influence price — many budget phones offer competitive specs in these areas.
- **Brand Distribution** is dominated by Xiaomi, Samsung, and Realme, indicating heavy mid-range market competition.

## 💡 Final Recommendations


- 📌 Focus new smartphone models around **₹15K–₹25K** — the most active price segment.
- ⚡ Ensure **5G and fast charging** support even in mid-range devices to increase perceived value.
- 💾 Prioritize **6GB+ RAM and 128GB+ storage** — these are strong selling points.
- 🔋 Avoid overinvesting in camera megapixels or large batteries — they don’t guarantee higher pricing.
- 🧠 Brands should differentiate through software experience and performance rather than just hardware specs.
